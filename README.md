“HydroConnect” Water Quality Monitoring Web Application

## Abstract
The "H2O for All Initiative" introduces a web application called “HydroConnect” designed to
address the issue of water quality in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
HydroConnect's goal is to empower communities in the DRC with the knowledge and tools
needed to make informed decisions about their water consumption. The web app gives
users a sense of ownership and engagement and aims to create a sustainable framework
for water resource management. HydroConnect is not just a technological innovation but a
resource for positive change, community resilience, and the realization of the fundamental
human right to clean and safe drinking water.
